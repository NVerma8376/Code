Fevicol
Fevicol  is an Indian brand of adhesives  owned by the
company Pidilite Industries .[3]
First introduced in India in 1959, Fevicol was launched
as a user-friendly alternative to traditional collagen  and
fat-based adhesives,  known locally as "saresh," which
required melting before application. The brand initially
focused on providing adhesives for industrial
applications and has since expanded its presence to 54
countries, with a significant market footprint in India.
Fevicol is marketed as a white adhesive, described in
company literature as a poly-synthetic resin . It is
manufactured through the synthesis of formaldehyde
and urea.[4]
The product line includes various formulations
designed for specific attributes such as bonding
strength, impact resistance, curing time, sag resistance,
shrinkage, versatili ty, fire resistance, shock and
vibration resistance, and non-staining properties.[5]
Variants like "Fevicol SH" are synthetic resin
adhesives primarily  used in wood working  and
applications where at least one surface is porous. It is
commonly used for bonding wood, plywood , laminate ,
veneers , MDF, cork,[6] and in the manufa cturing of
sporting goods and bookbinding. SH typically achieves
handling strength within 8 to 10 hours, with full curing
in 24 hours.History

In India, Fevicol has become synonymous with strong bonding or stubborn adhesion, often referenced in
Bollywood  movies, cultural jokes , and everyday conv ersations.[8] It is widely recognized as a generic
term for white glue among consumers in India.[9]
